Sample was pre-consolidated to 100 kPa during 20 minutes to seat the mold top cap before starting the high stress CSR consolidation phase. Testing procedure was developed taking into account the procedure stablished by Erickson (2013). Sample was air pluviated and pluviation procedure was defined by taking into consideration the pluviation procedure stablished by Ziotopoulou et al. (2013). Post-compression grain size distributions were done following ASTM D422 ÛÒ 63 and D1140 ÛÒ 00. Modifications to grain size distribution tests were made to follow steps suggested by Bardet (1997), Das (1997), Kalinski (2006) and Liu et al. (2013). "
